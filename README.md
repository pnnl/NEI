### Abstract
Making buildings more energy efficient is a critical component of energy affordability since it allows the home to consume less energy in operation. Energy efficiency in homes has been traditionally presented as a benefit to homeowners in terms of cost savings and environmental responsibility. However, there are additional collateral impacts that have the potential to benefit homeowners who make energy efficiency modifications. These non-energy impacts (NEIs) have been the subject of some discussion scattered throughout past literature, but it is challenging to fully quantify these benefits. There is still significant work needed to analyze NEIs at a national scale. This software quantifies the non-energy impacts of building retrofit measures by synthesizing and scaling publicly-available datasets in the US.
